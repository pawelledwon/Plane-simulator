# Flight Simulator Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Flight Simulator project! This project is a sophisticated flight simulation experience leveraging advanced VR and flight control technologies. The simulator is designed to provide an immersive and realistic flight experience using Unity, one of the leading game development engines.

## Technologies Used

### Hardware

1. **YAW VR**: A compact and versatile motion simulator that enhances the immersive experience by providing real-time physical feedback and motion cues.
2. **HP Reverb G2**: A high-resolution VR headset that delivers crisp visuals and spatial audio, ensuring an immersive virtual environment.
3. **Voland Saitek Pro Yoke System**: A professional-grade flight control system that offers realistic yoke and throttle controls for a true-to-life piloting experience.

### Software

- **Unity**: The core game engine used to develop the flight simulator. Unity provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating 3D environments, realistic physics, and interactive gameplay.

## Features

- **Realistic Flight Dynamics**: Simulates real-world flight physics to provide an authentic flying experience.
- **Immersive VR Environment**: Utilizes the HP Reverb G2 for high-fidelity visuals and 3D spatial audio.
- **Motion Feedback**: Integrates YAW VR to provide physical feedback and enhance immersion.
- **Advanced Flight Controls**: Supports the Voland Saitek Pro Yoke System for precise and responsive control inputs.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Unity installed (version 2022.3.21f1 or later).
- Set up the YAW VR, HP Reverb G2, and Voland Saitek Pro Yoke System according to their respective user manuals.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pawelledwon/Plane-simulator.git
   cd Plane-simulator
2. **Open the Project in Unity**

- Launch Unity Hub.
- Click on "Open" and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
- Select the project and open it.

3. **Configure VR Settings**

- Ensure that the VR settings in Unity are correctly configured for the HP Reverb G2.
- Import necessary VR plugins if not already included.

4. **Connect Hardware**

- Connect the YAW VR, HP Reverb G2, and Voland Saitek Pro Yoke System to your PC.
- Ensure that all drivers and software for these devices are properly installed and configured.

5. **Run the Simulator**
